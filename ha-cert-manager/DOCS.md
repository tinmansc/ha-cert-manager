# HA Cert Manager

Unified Let's Encrypt certificate deployment dashboard for your network devices. Deploy your HA-managed cert to TrueNAS, Hubitat, pfSense, TP-Link Omada, HPE switches, and Brother printers — all from one place.

## First-time setup

After installing the add-on, configure these controls before hitting Start:

| Control | Recommended | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Start on boot** | On | Add-on starts automatically when HA restarts |
| **Watchdog** | On | HA restarts the add-on if it crashes |
| **Auto update** | On | Picks up new device support and bug fixes |
| **Show in sidebar** | **--> On <--** | Adds Cert Manager to the HA sidebar for one-click access |

> **Show in sidebar is off by default.** Make sure to toggle it on — otherwise you won't have a shortcut to the dashboard.

Once all four are set, click **Start**.

## Opening the dashboard

After the add-on starts, click **Open Web UI** at the top of the add-on page, or use the **Cert Manager** entry in your sidebar (if you enabled Show in sidebar above).

## Configuring devices

On first launch the dashboard will be empty. Click **Add Device** and fill in the connection details for each network device you want to deploy certificates to. Supported device types:

- **TrueNAS** — TrueNAS CORE and SCALE via REST API
- **Brother MFC** — Brother MFC-J4335DW (and similar models with web-based cert upload)
- **Hubitat** — Hubitat Elevation C-7 via local API
- **HPE Comware 7** — HPE 1950 series switches via SSH (tested on 1950; likely works on any Comware 7 switch)
- **TP-Link Omada** — OC200 / OC300 controllers
- **pfSense** — pfSense firewalls via REST API

## SSL certificate path

The add-on reads your Let's Encrypt certificates from the HA `/ssl` volume (mounted read-only). The standard HA cert paths are:

```
/ssl/fullchain.pem
/ssl/privkey.pem
```

If you use a custom path (e.g. from the Duck DNS or Let's Encrypt add-ons), match those paths in each device's configuration.
