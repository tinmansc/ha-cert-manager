# Release Checklist

Run through this before every version bump and push to main.

---

## 1. Code changes complete
- [ ] All intended changes committed locally
- [ ] `run.sh` uses `#!/bin/sh` (NOT `#!/usr/bin/with-contenv bashio` — that requires HA base images)
- [ ] No hardcoded IP addresses, passwords, or test credentials left in code

## 2. Version bump
- [ ] `config.yaml` → `version:` incremented (semver: patch for fixes, minor for new devices/features)
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated with the new version, date, and bullet points for every change

## 3. config.yaml sanity check
- [ ] `image:` field has NO tag suffix (e.g. `ghcr.io/tinmansc/ha-cert-manager` — no `:latest`, no `:{version}`)
- [ ] `url:` points to `https://github.com/tinmansc/ha-cert-manager`
- [ ] `arch:` lists both `aarch64` and `amd64`
- [ ] `ingress: true` and `ingress_port: 8099` are present

## 4. Frontend built (if frontend changed)
- [ ] `cd frontend && npm run build` completes without errors
- [ ] `frontend/dist/` is up to date (CI rebuilds it, but verify locally if you changed React code)

## 5. Push to GitHub
- [ ] `git status` — no unintended files staged
- [ ] `git push origin main`
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow triggered (check Actions tab)

## 6. Wait for CI
- [ ] Build and Push to GHCR workflow shows green for the new version
- [ ] Confirm `ghcr.io/tinmansc/ha-cert-manager:<version>` appears in GHCR packages
- [ ] GHCR package visibility is still **Public**

## 7. Verify on test HA (10.10.101.91)
- [ ] Supervisor picks up the new version (may take a few minutes to re-scan the repo)
- [ ] "Update available" appears on the add-on page
- [ ] Update completes without error
- [ ] Add-on starts and shows **Running** (green dot)
- [ ] "Open Web UI" loads the dashboard

## 8. Deploy to production HA
- [ ] Run `deploy.ps1` if backend or frontend changed
- [ ] In HA: Settings → Apps → Cert Manager → ⋮ → **Rebuild** (not Restart)
- [ ] Add-on restarts and shows Running

> **Common mistakes we've already made:**
> - `image:` field had `:{version}` tag → Supervisor rejects it silently, add-on never appears in store
> - `run.sh` shebang was `#!/usr/bin/with-contenv bashio` → crashes on startup in plain Python base image
> - Pushed two version bumps back-to-back before CI finished the first → update UI shows error while image is still building
> - Forgot to wait for GHCR build before testing update on HA → "image not found" pull error
